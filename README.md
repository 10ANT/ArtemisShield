## ‚ö†Ô∏è The Problem

Wildfire management is often a race against time with fragmented information. Officers need to synthesize data from satellites, field reports, and weather forecasts under immense pressure. Making the right decision can be the difference between containment and catastrophe.

---

## üí° Our Solution

ArtemisShield is a unified, intelligent command and control platform that transforms wildfire management from reactive to proactive. It centralizes real-time data from satellites, weather, and field reports, augmenting human decision-making with powerful Azure AI. This includes an **AI Co-Pilot** for natural language queries, **Azure Custom Vision** for early hotspot detection, and **Azure Machine Learning** for predicting fire behavior. **Azure Speech-to-Text** also simplifies field reporting. ArtemisShield provides clear, actionable intelligence, helping commanders save lives, protect property, and manage wildfires more effectively.

---

## ‚ú® Key Features

Our Solution provides a unified, intelligent dashboard that centralizes real-time data and augments human decision-making with powerful AI:

* üó∫Ô∏è **Interactive Geo-Dashboard**: A multi-layered Leaflet map showing official perimeters, live satellite hotspots (MODIS/VIIRS), weather overlays, and community-sourced alerts. Also allows for measuring and annotating of the maps for a more controlled and personal analyzation done by the user.

* ü§ñ **AI Co-Pilot (Azure AI Agent)**: A conversational agent that interacts with the map. Officers can ask questions in natural language like *"Show me the risk to infrastructure near the Canyon Fire"* or *"Plan an evacuation route from Pine Ridge to the nearest shelter."*

* üõ∞Ô∏è **Automated GOES Analysis (Azure Custom Vision)**: Users can analyze GOES satellite imagery in real-time. Our Custom Vision model detects and highlights potential fire hotspots that may not yet be in official reports.

* üß† **Predictive Intelligence (Azure ML)**: A machine learning model predicts fire intensity (FRP) and fire spread based on satellite data, giving officers a forward-looking view of a fire's potential. It also uses image classification to predict risk of wildfire in particular areas based on satellite imagery giving analysts key data to analyse vulnerable places and suggest environmental assistances.

* üé§ **Voice-to-Text Field Reporting (Azure Speech)**: Firefighters in the field can log reports using their voice. Azure Speech services transcribe the audio, which is then analyzed for key entities (locations, resources needed) and summarized using Azure AI Language.

* üö® **Real-Time Alerting (Pusher & Laravel Echo)**: Community alerts and critical updates are broadcast to all users in real-time using Pusher and Echo which allows for a speedy and easy accessibility to updated information by end users.

## ü§ù Responsible AI Commitment

We built ArtemisShield with Microsoft's Responsible AI principles at its core:

* **Fairness:** The AI model for intensity prediction was trained on a diverse dataset to avoid geographical bias. The AI Agent's tools are designed to provide objective data, not make final life-or-death decisions. All natural language content can be translated to a multitude of languages.

* **Reliability & Safety:** Critical AI outputs (like predictions) are clearly labeled as "AI-Generated" with confidence scores to prevent over-reliance. The system has fallbacks for when an AI service is unavailable. All data used in association with the AI has been verified and chosen to be some of the most useful and relevant for its usage in the system.

* **Privacy & Security:** All user data is handled securely. Authentication is managed by Laravel Jetstream which enforces several encryption techniques to keep personal user data in safe hands and out of harm's way.

* **Inclusiveness:** The UI uses high-contrast themes and clear iconography. Voice-to-text reporting aids users who cannot type in the field as well as text translation for non-native speakers to have equal access to the platform.

* **Transparency:** Our architecture and the role of each AI component are clearly documented here. The AI Agent explains which tool it is using to fulfill a request. All data sources are cited and the project is made open source.

* **Accountability:** The system is designed as a decision-support tool, keeping the human officer in the loop and accountable for the final commands.
